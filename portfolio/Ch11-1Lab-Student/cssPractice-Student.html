		<p>LANGLEY, VA&mdash;A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.</p>

		<p>According to the report, sections of the document&mdash; "almost invariably the most crucial passages" &mdash;are marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.</p>

		<p>CIA Director <b>Porter Goss</b> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of several historic events, such as: </p>
		<ul>   
		<li>the Cold War</li> 
		<li>the civil-rights movement</li> 
		<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
		</ul>
