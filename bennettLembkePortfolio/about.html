  <h2>About Bennett</h2> 

  <p>I found my interest in coding when I was searching for a good job and saw that developers and programmers make pretty good money. I am working on my associate degree in software development.  The first year focused on client-side technologies and the second on server-side languages. </p>
  
 <p> For almost 2 years I have been focused on becoming the best developer that I can be and perfecting my problem-solving skills. I used my time wisely and took part in Business Professionals of America and the CWI Gaming Club. </p>
  
   
  
  <h2>Work Experience</h2>
  
  <p>For my last semester I was employed as a CWI Embedded Tutor for first year software development students</p>
